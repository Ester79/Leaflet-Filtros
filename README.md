## Level 1

### Phase 1
Create a database called my_app along with the restaurants table. 
Add at least 10 restaurants, keeping in mind that a restaurant can have more than one different type of food.

Hint: kind_food is of type SET


### Phase 2
1.Install an Apache server (Xampp Program). Copy the contents of the following folder https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TibiYl3HMllgDWGm2Sk9gfXUOn2bSYBI/view to:
Ubuntu: / opt / lamp / htdocs
Windows: C /: xampp / htdocs
Mac: You will need to mount a drive

2.Open a browser and type:
http: //localhost/mapa/api/apiRestaurants.php (to load the API with the restaurant json)
http: //localhost/mapa/index.html (to load the map)
Keep in mind that the path to the API does not have to be absolute. Use the methods offered by PHP or JavaScript to know the path of the server


### Phase 3
The goal of this phase will be to program part 3.1 and 3.2 with javascript (+ jquery).


## Level 2
Create a new field in the database called photo, which is a 30-character varchar. 
We need the photo to appear along with the rest of the information when we click on a bookmark.


## Level 3
The center of the map should be our current actual GPS position.
